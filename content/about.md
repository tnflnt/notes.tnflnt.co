**Hi! I'm Tony Folenta. I build design systems for digital products.**

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been the Design Systems Manager at [Keller Williams](https://kw.com/), the world‚Äôs largest real estate brokerage, in Austin, TX. I lead system design and development for Command, our platform of agent business tools.

Previously, I was a Lead Product Designer at [Strava](https://strava.com/) in San Francisco, building applications for Strava‚Äôs community of over 50 million athletes around the world. I also helped establish a design systems team at Strava that launched the Strava brand and product design system, Spandex.

I got my start in design at [Odopod](http://odopod.com/), a product and service design agency in San Francisco. As a visual designer, I helped build products for dozens of clients, including Eventbrite, Sony, Google, Samsung, and others.

This site is my personal blog; for a sample of my work, visit [tonyfolenta.com](https://tonyfolenta.com).

## To Do

[tnflnt.co](/) is my personal notebook. I'll share links, weeknotes, articles, photos, whatever seems right.

This site is built on Hugo and hosted by Netlify. The Hugo theme is fork of [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie); you can check out the site repository [here](https://github.com/tnflnt/notes.tnflnt.co).

Here's an incomplete list of things I still need to do:

- ~~Properly configure OG & Twitter metadata for pages.~~ Done, I think? It seems to be working now.
- ~~Add "reply by email" to Post template.~~
- Clean up the dark mode theme, or find a smarter way to apply these styles. Not a huge fan of the Archie approach.
- Fix the RSS feed to provide full-text articles. More importantly: learn how the RSS template works.

Thanks for stopping by. ‚úåüèª
