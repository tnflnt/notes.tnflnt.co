**Hi! I‚Äôm Tony. I build design systems and digital products.**

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been the Design Systems Manager at [Keller Williams](https://kw.com/), the world‚Äôs largest real estate brokerage, in Austin, TX. I lead system design and development for Command, our platform of agent business tools.

Previously, I was a Lead Product Designer at [Strava](https://strava.com/) in San Francisco, building applications for Strava‚Äôs community of over 50 million athletes around the world. I also helped establish a design systems team at Strava that launched the Strava brand and product design system, Spandex.

I got my start in design at [Odopod](http://odopod.com/), a product and service design agency in San Francisco. As a visual designer, I helped build products for dozens of clients, including Eventbrite, Sony, Google, Samsung, and others.

## This Site

[notes.tnflnt.co](/) is my personal notebook. I'll share links, weekly recaps, articles, photos, whatever seems right.

This site is built on Hugo and hosted by Netlify. It will change often; a website as a worry stone, [to paraphrase Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). The Hugo theme is fork of [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie); you can check out the site repository [here](https://github.com/tnflnt/notes.tnflnt.co).

Want to chat? Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hi@tnflnt.co). Alternatively, you can find me around the internet at *@tnflnt*.
