##### Highlights

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been the Design Systems Manager at [Keller Williams](https://kw.com/), the world‚Äôs largest real estate brokerage, in Austin, TX. I lead system design and development for Command, our platform of agent business tools.

Previously, I was a Lead Product Designer at [Strava](https://strava.com/) in San Francisco, building applications for Strava‚Äôs community of over 50 million athletes around the world. I also helped establish a design systems team at Strava that launched the Strava brand and product design system, Spandex.

I got my start in design at [Odopod](http://odopod.com/), a product and service design agency in San Francisco. As a visual designer, I helped build products for dozens of clients, including Eventbrite, Sony, Google, Samsung, and others.
