##### Highlights

Since 2019, I’ve been the design systems manager at [Keller Williams](https://technology.kw.com/), the world’s largest real estate brokerage. I lead design system development for Command, our platform of agent business tools. In 2021, I became a product design manager, helping manage and grow our in-house design team. ([We're hiring!](https://jobs.lever.co/kwx?department=Keller%20Williams&team=Technology))

On the side, I’m the Executive Vice President of Design (a.k.a. the only designer) for [Patina](https://patina.yoga), a yoga journaling app built by my good friend [Rodrigo](https://twitter.com/rawdrigo).

Previously, I was a lead product designer at [Strava](https://strava.com/) in San Francisco, building experiences for Strava’s community of over 50 million athletes around the world. I also helped establish a design systems team at Strava that launched the Strava brand and product design system, [Spandex](https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Strava-Brand-Guidelines-04.2021_V2.pdf).

I got my start in design at [Odopod](http://odopod.com/), a product and service design agency in San Francisco. As a visual designer, I helped build products for dozens of clients, including Eventbrite, Sony, Google, Samsung, and others.

I’m currently based in Chicago with my partner and our kids, Dale 🐕 and Taco 🐈.
