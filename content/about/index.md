##### Highlights

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been the design systems manager at [Keller Williams](https://technology.kw.com/), the world‚Äôs largest real estate brokerage. I lead design system development for Command, our platform of agent business tools. In 2021, I became a product design manager, helping manage and grow our in-house design team. ([We're hiring!](https://jobs.lever.co/kwx?department=Keller%20Williams&team=Technology))

On the side, I‚Äôm the Executive Vice President of Design (a.k.a. the only designer) for [Patina](https://patina.yoga), a yoga journaling app built by my good friend [Rodrigo](https://twitter.com/rawdrigo).

Previously, I was a lead product designer at [Strava](https://strava.com/) in San Francisco, building experiences for Strava‚Äôs community of over 50 million athletes around the world. I also helped establish a design systems team at Strava that launched the Strava brand and product design system, [Spandex](https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Strava-Brand-Guidelines-04.2021_V2.pdf).

I got my start in design at [Odopod](http://odopod.com/), a product and service design agency in San Francisco. As a visual designer, I helped build products for dozens of clients, including Eventbrite, Sony, Google, Samsung, and others.

I‚Äôm currently based in Chicago with my partner and our kids, Dale üêï and Taco üêà.

##### About tnflnt.co

This site is built with Hugo, hosted on Netlify, and based on [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) by [@athul](https://github.com/athul). It‚Äôs a work-in-progress that I tinker with from time to time. Typography is by Connary Fagen: [Greycliff](https://connary.com/greycliff.html) for headings and body, [Cartograph](https://connary.com/cartograph.html) for monospaced text and code.

**To Do:**

- ~~Responsive images~~ [*Done!*](http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/04/responsive-images-in-hugo/)
- ~~Auto dark mode~~ *Done!* Next: user-controlled dark mode
- Better image layouts: wide images, side-by-side images, etc.
- Full-text RSS feed
- Finish importing my portfolio of work
- SVG icons
- Better button styling
- Properly learn [go templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/)
- More writing

If you‚Äôd like to see samples of my work, or just want to chat, [say hi](mailto:hi@tnflnt.co). 

Thanks for stopping by. ‚úåüèª
