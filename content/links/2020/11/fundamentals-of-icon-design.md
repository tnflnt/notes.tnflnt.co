From Noah Jacobus at Metalab, a [super nice Figma worksheet](https://www.figma.com/community/file/868494350497530898/Icons-%26-You-%E2%80%93-Fundamentals-Worksheet) on the fundamentals of icon design. Lots of good stuff in here — setting up key shapes, choosing stroke styles, how to handle stroke intersection, and more. If you're just beginning to design an icon library, start here! 

He's also got a [great overview article](https://www.metalab.co/blog/fundamentals-of-icon-design) explaining the considerations that go into icon design up on the Metalab blog.
