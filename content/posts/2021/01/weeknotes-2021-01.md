**Hello, 2021!** These are [weeknotes](https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9): a weekly log of what happened in my life. Highlights, stray observations, things I listened to/read/watched/cooked, and a snapshot or two from the week. Let’s begin… 

## Highlights

- Back to work. Slack was down Monday morning. You and me both, Slack.
- The Georgia Senate elections are over, Biden’s been confirmed by Congress, and a few thousand MAGA chuds lost their goddamn minds at the Capitol. The internet reckoning and deplatforming has been *immensely satisfying*.
- Started setting some streaks for the year. First up, Work Out (at least 3× weekly). ✅
- A solid week of journaling, and daily entries in the weeknotes log. 🎉
- Started a draft year-in-review for 2020. Maybe I’ll finish and post it. Maybe I’ll just keep that to myself.
- Trying something new: no TV after 9PM on weeknights. I put the dog and myself to bed, then an hour or so for journaling and reading, and off to sleep. Seems healthy, right?
- TIL: the [“MoSCoW Method”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have. I dig it.
- Helping the team migrate from Figma’s Pro plan to Figma for Orgs. It’s a bit like we’ve moved out of a 1-bedroom apartment to a mansion, and all 20-odd kids get their own rooms.
- A bit of planning work on the side project. More to come on that when we’re out of beta… 
- Tried some [Coconut Milk-Braised Chicken Legs](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/coconut-milk-braised-chicken-legs) from Bon Appetit. The flavors were good, but I did these with boneless/skinless thighs and that was a poor choice. I’ll give them another shot with legs.
- A newly rebuilt [notes.tnflnt.co](https://notes.tnflnt.co), now running on its own Hugo/Netlify instance. Lots of style cleanup. Lots left to do.

## Reading

- [Dan Mall’s “Year in Review”](http://danmall.me/articles/2020-year-in-review/). Inspired me to try a few new things in 2021, starting with these weeknotes.
- [“The Plague Year” by Lawrence Wright for The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year). Made it about halfway through this article novel last week, finished it up this week. Extremely significant read. I read Wright’s [*God Save Texas*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35457359-god-save-texas) last summer and he’s the perfect writer to tell a story like this. If it’s too much, [Washington Post has a good tl;dr](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/01/04/my-takeaways-plague-year/).
- [Simon Collison’s “This used to be our playground”](https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground), a yearning for the days of fun personal sites, and a call to action to bring them back. He also references [Ethan Marcotte’s “Let a website be a worry stone.”](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), which has been rolling around my brain for the last 10 months or so.
- [“The lessons learnt creating a design system for BBC online”](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/articles/creating-a-design-system-for-bbc), from Dave Morris and Josh Tumath. Levers for fun! Love this methodology.
- A few dozen articles about the clownery at the Capitol, but the two that stuck with me: [“They Were Out for Blood” on Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/was-there-a-plan-for-hostages-or-killings-at-the-capitol.html), and a [gut-wrenching interview with Congresswoman Pramiya Jayapal over on The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/2021/01/pramila-jayapal-surviving-capitol-riots.html). There’s been a lot of joking around this week about the insurrection, but underneath the bullshit is deep shit.
- To lighten things up, [*A Memory Called Empire* by Arkady Martine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39873472-a-memory-called-empire). Always down for some sci-fi; this one’s got a very LeGuin vibe to it.

## Watching

- The *Lord of the Rings* trilogy. Still holds up; the last one’s the best one.
- *Cobra Kai*. Fun trash. 
- *Guy’s Grocery Games*. Like if *Chopped* didn’t take itself so seriously.
- *Mad Men*. Wrapped season 1, 2, 3, on to season 4, and Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Highlights: the lawn mower ([*Guy Walks Into An Advertising Agency*](https://tv.avclub.com/mad-men-guy-walks-into-an-advertising-agency-1798206995)); classy corporate sabotage ([*Shut The Door. Have A Seat.*](https://tv.avclub.com/mad-men-shut-the-door-have-a-seat-1798207478)).
- *The Flight Attendant*. Started out a panic attack, turned into a trip.
- *Letterkenny*. I do still love it, and there’s some gems in the latest season ([*Sleepover*](https://www.hulu.com/watch/995ddb5e-38bb-49f9-9f3f-ad775c758680)), but at this point, it’s ferda fans.

## Listening

- [“Bedtime Beats”](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/bedtime-beats/pl.082e7836ea7a4244bf3f9c319560718f) on Apple Music. Good wind-down, bedtime journaling and reading soundtrack.
- New year, new annual playlist: here’s [20—21](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/20-21/pl.u-4qM3T6AZyb).

And, even though this is *technically* from “next” week, I couldn’t resist — it snowed in Austin and Dale had his first snow day! Still not too sure about this snow stuff.
