Week 2! A snow day in Texas, another impeachment, a weekend in Houston, and once again, too much TV. 2020 Part II continues.

## Highlights

- Snow! In Austin! The planet’s dying, but [the dog had a wonderful time in the slush](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ4DzB4jZUi/).
- This blog is alive and kicking, but needs some improvement. Keeping track of all planned updates on the [About](https://tnflnt.co/about/) page.
- Fought a bit with Ulysses over CloudKit database conflicts and the weird choices it makes with Markdown. Switched back to iA Writer with its standard folders and plain-text files. I want to love Ulysses. I never do.
- Continuing the weekly workouts: Tuesday, back and biceps; Thursday: chest and Triceps; Saturday… ok I skipped Saturday. I’m lifting from home with resistance bands and a [Gorilla Bow](https://www.gorillabow.com); it puts up a decent fight! However, I lack the flexibility to do squats with it.
- I think I could use a real vacation. I’ve been extremely busy the first two weeks of 2021, and yet, I feel like I’ve accomplished nothing. Of course, what’s a vacation in pandemic time? A cabin in Texas hill country for a week? I’ll take a weekend in Houston with the boy, for now.

## Reading

- [Samin Nosrat’s interview with Earlonne Woods about cooking for yourself while incarcerated](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/magazine/this-chicken-and-rice-is-perfect-home-cooking-with-prison-roots.html), and her process of developing a recipe for chicken and rice based on his own improvisation. *“Each time I made it, the dish filled my cold kitchen with the sort of home-​warming aromas I wanted Woods to enjoy,”* she writes. *“Prison dehumanizes the incarcerated in part by denying them so many of the sensory experiences of life, including the small, essential delights we take for granted when we cook — the scent of onions cooking in butter or chicken broth simmering away on the stove.”*
- [“Denial Is the Heartbeat of America”](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/denial-heartbeat-america/617631/) by Ibram X. Kendi. [This is America.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY)
- [This eco-fascism explainer over at The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/154971/rise-ecofascism-history-white-nationalism-environmental-preservation-immigration), that I came across a few links deep into [Emily Atkins’ *Heated* newsletter](https://heated.world/p/the-antler-guy-isnt-a-climate-activist) covering Jake Angeli, the horned insurrectionist who refused to eat in prison because he wasn’t being fed organic.
- [“I Recommend Eating Chips”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/magazine/i-recommend-eating-chips.html)— cheese-covered escapism, by Sam Anderson.
- [“Why can’t I write code inside my browser?”](https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/) by Tom Critchlow, rethinking browsers and code playgrounds. 
- [“Go Ahead. Fantasize.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/style/go-ahead-fantasize.html) Coping with the now by imagining the future, by Tariro Mzezewa.

## Watching

- *Mad Men*. Finished season 4, onto season 5. This is about where I dropped off years ago. My god, [Don and Megan’s apartment](https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6a00d8341c630a53ef0167645f128c970b.jpg).
- *The Expanse*, season 5. A pretty hefty escalation of the war between the inner planets and the belt holds your attention, but pacing issues still plague the show. Still, a great story.
- *RuPaul’s Drag Race*, season 13. It’s reality TV in a pandemic! We’ve got the queens split into two groups — minimize contact! Maximize villainy! [Gottmik was robbed](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ1Tf5KAExB/), [Tamisha slaughters everyone in the loser’s circle](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKF8JJElcdU/).
- *American Gods*, season 2 and 3. After all the departures and drama between the first and second season I must have skipped over it, but it’s back for season 3 so we played catch-up. I’m here for [Dominique Jackson and her bat](https://media.giphy.com/media/hnn9goqBMK9sXfYSzm/source.gif).  
- *The Magicians*, season 5. I’m just here for the Eliot and Margo show.

And that’s it! What wonders will week 3 hold? It’s inauguration week, so let’s see how my anxiety handles that.
