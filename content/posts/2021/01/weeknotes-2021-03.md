Forty-six.

## Highlights
- [New President just dropped](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/01/20/inaugural-address-by-president-joseph-r-biden-jr/).
- Habits update: completely fell off the ‚Äúwork out at home‚Äù wagon. NO ONE saw that coming.
- Recipe of the week: [Instant Pot Carnitas](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/instant-pot-pork-carnitas). I‚Äôve made this recipe from Bon App√©tit a few times, and it‚Äôs foolproof. It‚Äôs a perfect Instant Pot recipe: dump-and-go ‚úÖ, turn hours into minutes ‚úÖ, leftovers that actually taste good for the next day or three ‚úÖ. 
    - Into the pot: 3-4lb pork shoulder, cubed; 2 jalape√±os, halved, stems and seeds removed; a handful of garlic cloves; a few big pinches of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper; a teaspoon each of cumin, coriander, and oregano. I also like to nestle an orange, quartered, in among the pork. 
    - Pressure cook on high for 35 minutes. Shred the pork, strain the juices and mix with the shredded meat, and fry up a handful in a skillet for a few minutes to get those crispy pork bits. 
    - Leftover shredded pork goes in the fridge, to be reheated by crisping later. I also turned the leftovers into a carnitas pizza: refried beans, sliced provolone, sour cream, a bit of shredded mozz, carnitas, and candied jalape√±os. A sprinkling of cotija after the oven. It‚Äôs been a piggy week. üê∑

## Reading
- [We‚Äôre underselling the vaccine and it‚Äôs time to change this approach](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/briefing/donald-trump-pardon-phil-spector-coronavirus-deaths.html), writes David Leonhardt in NYT‚Äôs *The Morning* newsletter. Also: wear better masks. 
- I came across one essay by [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/) and ended up reading all of them. [Thoughts on newsletters](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters), [mistakes in design systems](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea), [web typography](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/the-new-web-typography)‚Ä¶ 
- I think I‚Äôm gonna be a *~newsletter guy~* this year? I signed up for a few. I‚Äôm still very big on RSS, but maybe newsletters have something interesting to offer. *(PS ‚Äî this site has an [RSS feed](https://tnflnt.co/index.xml), but avoid it for now; I need to reconfigure it to deliver full-text posts instead of summaries, so there might be some spam-testing. I hate summary feeds.)*
- [An interview with Wilson Miner at staff.design](https://staff.design/wilson-miner), a new project from [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com) exploring the career path of individual contributors in design. 

## Watching
- The inauguration ceremonies were great, but the highlight, by far, was Amanda Gorman, the National Youth Poet Laureate, reciting her poem ‚ÄúThe Hill We Climb.‚Äù [Watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ055ilIiN4).
- In TV land, we binged *Night Stalker*. True crime‚Äôs not really my thing. 
- Started a rewatch of *Broad City*. I love it‚Ä¶ less? 
- *Mad Men*, season 6, the long, sad decline of Don. What a fun-filled shitshow. Ken Cosgrove barely making it out of Detroit alive, the amphetamine-fueled Chevy pitch, [Stan the human dartboard](https://i.imgur.com/WdEEy2R.gif), [‚ÄúAbe got stabbed.‚Äù](https://media.gq.com/photos/558287e7e52bc4b477a96be7/master/pass/blogs-the-feed-a_560x0.gif), [NOT GREAT, BOB](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AlarmingOptimisticAustraliankestrel-small.gif). Five stars.
- Wrapped up *The Flight Attendant*. Another winner in the ‚ÄúMAX Originals‚Äù stable, alongside *Raised By Wolves*.
- *The Great North*, a new adult animated sitcom from the creators of *Bob‚Äôs Burgers*. A Brokeback Mountain-themed wedding and a ‚Äúsexi moose‚Äù. I think I love it.
- *Drag Race*, season 13. Kahmora who?
- *The Expanse*, season 5. 
- *American Gods*, season 3. Feels like this season is hewing a bit closer to the source material. Fingers crossed this hot mess sticks the landing.

## Listening
- [*Summer Vibes*](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/summer-vibes/pl.6cbec98d25194addb2b012e681e0eff6) on Apple Music. 
- A *Mad Men* marathon comes with a renewed appreciation for the music of the 60‚Äôs. Highlight of season 6 ‚Äî Nancy Sinatra‚Äôs [‚ÄúYou Only Live Twice‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTiDKcFGpCQ). (Bonus cover: [‚ÄúMillennium‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcWOviMI6Lk) by Robbie Williams.)


Week three, in the books. It‚Äôs been gray and rainy here in Austin, so we stay inside and eat tacos.
