Seasonal depression, brought to you by a pandemic.

> **pandemic fine** — *noun* — a state of being in which you are employed and healthy during a pandemic but you're also tired and depressed and feel like trash all the time

## Highlights
- Finally got around to doing a bit of work on the other side project. I should ask my secret partner if he’s cool with me writing about it.
- This was one of those work weeks where I did everything but the things I set out to do. Each day, I spent a good amount of time helping my teammates solve design problems. This is good! It’s good for the team. Less good for my project. Next week: no email or Slack before noon.
- What a year, huh? Lemon, it’s January.

## Reading
- [“Welcome to the Graveyard of New Year’s Resolutions.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/health/resolutions-dry-january.html)
- Arun Venkatesan has an illustrated deep-dive into the face design of the Apple Watch, detailing [the classic watches that inspired Apple Watch faces](https://www.arun.is/blog/apple-watch-faces/). If you’re at all interested in horology, it’s a great look at the basics of watch design.
- Om Malik, on [the iPhone as today’s Kodak Brownie](https://om.co/2021/01/24/why-iphone-is-todays-kodak-brownie-camera/).

## Watching
- *Mad Men*, the final season. It’s the 70’s and Peggy finally got with Hot Stan. What a great show.
- *Soul*, for the second time. We watched it on Christmas Day, but it really deserves a rewatch. There’s so much detail, so many quick little scenes, it’s impossible to take it all in with only one shot. “There’s a lot of Garcias.”
- *Ted Lasso*, the rewatch. A shining bright spot from 2020. 
- Others: *Broad City* (I take back my statement from last week, there’s some gems in there — shrooms!), *The Expanse*, *Drag Race* (lordt, [this look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XbcXhA36RY)). 

## Listening
- [Miley Cyrus, *Plastic Hearts*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/plastic-hearts/1536966025). It’s not bad, but the best bit is the [Edge of Seventeen/Midnight Sky remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CoOLtQbmJI) with Stevie Nicks. All that said, I’ve loved what she’s put out over the last couple years — [“Younger Now”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LX2kpeyp80) and [“Slide Away”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrvFv6j3-sM) are excellent, and I don’t care what Pitchfork says.
- [“Groove”](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/groove/pl.d73049603d7143ec86d84fc8b8af3827) on Apple Music. Making me heartsick for the days of San Francisco block parties and sweaty, messy club nights.

And that’s it. This week’s notes were a bit short; I think the crushing weight of reality might have worn me down. At least I’ve got this one to keep me company.
