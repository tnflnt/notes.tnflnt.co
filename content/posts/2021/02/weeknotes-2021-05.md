A bit more sunlight, a weekend in Houston, and Zillow. It’s week five.

## Highlights
- The sun finally came out! Me and my houseplants were feeling starved for some nice ultraviolet rays.
- Made a big pot of beef stew, full of root veggies. We’re trying to eat a bit healthier this month. I would share the recipe, but what are the ethics around sharing recipes from a book? [It’s a very good book.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35503980-the-essential-instant-pot-cookbook) If you’ve got an Instant Pot, you should get this book.
- Working on protecting my time; setting away messages in Slack and only checking in every couple of hours instead of letting it run in the background. It worked, a bit.
- Spent the weekend in Houston so the dog could chase the cat.

## Reading
- [Dave Rupert’s monthly “vibe check”](https://daverupert.com/2021/02/vibe-check-1/), a lower-stress sort of new year’s resolution.
- [Michael Harriot tells his story of visiting a Charleston plantation.](https://www.americanway.com/articles/what-happens-when-the-descendant-of-an-enslaved-person-tours-charleston-plantations/) It’s a beautiful piece. A snippet:
> “Charleston still thrives on the sweat-stained history of slavery that, for centuries, has been treated as if it wasn’t a primary reason for this city’s existence. The plantation tourism industry has created an impressionist painting of this town’s history—all color, no shadows. Perhaps that is why it took more tragedy to un-whitewash this canvas and begin the process of telling the city’s history honestly. But I must admit—it really is gorgeous.”

## Watching
- [This guy making a poblano con queso taco.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtkyC2Ctz6E) Bookmarked for the next apartment I have with a gas stove.
- *Breaking Bad*. This might be my second rewatch. Just killing time until there’s more *Better Call Saul* on Netflix.
- *Search Party*. We binged the first season over the weekend. Terrible people making terrible choices and yet, you feel bad for them? Love it.
- *Bonding*, season 2. A fun little snack. Now with puppy play.
- The *Saw* collection is on HBO! As a teenager, my best friend and I would see these in theaters the day they came out every year. I have a soft spot for trash horror.
- “Looking for something to spice up your life? You used to want sex, but you’re in your *late 30’s* now. You need a new fantasy. You need… [Zillow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEfsaXDX0UQ).”

And that’s it. We’re looking at another chilly week, so let’s see if we can keep our spirits up. I ordered some fancy cocktail picks for my Old Fashioneds, that’ll do the trick.
