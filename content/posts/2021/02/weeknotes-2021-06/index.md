Hitting the pandemic wall, treating it with retail therapy. It‚Äôs week six.

## Highlights

It‚Äôs been a week of Amazon shopping to maintain my tenuous grasp on reality in this endlessly gray, isolated pandemic winter. What did we buy this week?

- [A Doxie scanner.](https://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go) Verdict: üòç 
	- Years ago, I bought a [Wirecutter-recommended document scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Workforce-ES-300W-Wireless-Sheet-fed/dp/B01MFBVS1E). I would use it maybe twice a year, each time getting so angry at the software that I‚Äôd throw it back in the drawer, my pile of papers always growing. I don‚Äôt care if it can scan multiple sheets, duplex, whatever; if I can‚Äôt get those scans on my computer in less than 5 minutes, it‚Äôs not worth it.
	- The Doxie is great. It‚Äôs *tiny*, maybe the size of a cardboard paper towel tube. It has two buttons: power, and a button to turn on WiFi. It charges over USB, it scans to an SD card, and it has apps. They are good.
	- To scan a document: turn on the Doxie, line up the page in the front, wait for the Doxie to suck it through, and turn off the Doxie. That‚Äôs it. Pull the SD card out of the back and plug it in to a computer if you want, or plug the Doxie in via USB and it acts like any other external drive. The Doxie apps are really just for editing scans and merging multiple pages into single PDF‚Äôs. Think of the Doxie like a digital camera that takes pictures of paper. It does one thing, and it does that thing *extraordinarily well*.
	- One note: it is not exactly *fast*. For scanning a few sheets of paper every month or two, it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs a single-sided scanner, without a multi-sheet document feeder, and just writing that sentence I got bored so if you know you need that, I don‚Äôt know, get a real scanner, I‚Äôll be over here with my Doxie.
- [Cocktail picks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FR85TTB/), [Luxardo cherries](https://www.amazon.com/Luxardo-Maraschino-Cherries-418-mL/dp/B00AQB146W/), and [demerara syrup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XB1WHFD/). Verdict: ü•É
- [A CamLink 4K video capture card.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K3FN5MR/) Verdict: üé•
	- Early in the pandemic, I bought a [Logitech StreamCam](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-StreamCam-Streaming-Camera-Mount-Versatility/dp/B07W4DHS5B/). It is‚Ä¶ terrible. See the post from Jeff Carlson below.
	- I had a GoPro sitting in a drawer. So, I bought the CamLink, and turned my GoPro into a webcam. It worked. I still wasn‚Äôt happy.
	- I then tried setting up my Fujifilm X-T3 as a webcam [with their official app](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/software/x-webcam/). It, too, worked. But something was off.
	- Then I ran the X-T3 through the CamLink, following [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZa9QH1XI5k). A massive improvement over the X Webcam app. The app seemed to have dynamic range issues, and also seemed to be spitting out a low-resolution feed, with no way to improve it. The CamLink fixed all these issues: immediate startup, great dynamic range, much higher quality. I‚Äôm not sure what the Fujifilm Webcam app is doing, but whatever it is, it‚Äôs not great.
	- So, I‚Äôve got my X-T3 running through a CamLink, and that‚Äôs my webcam. It‚Äôs great. But then, I realized I don‚Äôt actually want to look at my face in high-def. What a week.

## Reading

- [Hitting the pandemic wall.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/pandemic-wall-covid-vaccines-variant-winter/2021/02/08/d48e0722-6599-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html) Evidently, I‚Äôm not losing my mind alone. 
- Tom MacWright‚Äôs blog. In particular, I like his [*Recently*](https://macwright.com/2021/02/01/recently.html) posts; a summary of the previous month or so. If (when) I get tired of weeknotes, maybe that would be a nice format. 
- Josh W. Comeau has an illustrated, interactive [guide to CSS transitions](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/). Lots of fun toys in this one.
- An investigation into [Facebook‚Äôs automated rejection of adaptive fashion ads](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/style/disabled-fashion-facebook-discrimination.html), from The New York Times.
- A deep dive into [why webcams are trash](https://reincubate.com/support/how-to/why-are-webcams-bad/), from Jeff Carlson. He is 100% correct. I bought a Logitech StreamCam (a newly released $170 webcam) last April, and I‚Äôve hated it since.

## Watching

- *The Expanse*, season 5 finale. Feeling like there‚Äôs not much resolution happening here. Sometimes the pace of this show is just‚Ä¶ not great. However, points for the ‚Äúescape from Earth‚Äù plotline of this season.
- *Breaking Bad*, season 2 and 3. 
- *Drag Race*. Elliott absolutely crushed that lip-sync.

And that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm currently huddled up inside with the dog as a cold front blows through Texas. Maybe we‚Äôll get some more snow! I‚Äôll leave you with a product endorsement, truly the highlight of pandemic fashion: Crocs. Two thumbs up.
