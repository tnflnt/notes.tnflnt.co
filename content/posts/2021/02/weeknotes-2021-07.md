Not sure if you heard, but it snowed in Texas, and our infrastructure crumbled to dust.

This has been the only thing on my mind this week as I live through a natural disaster layered on top of a pandemic, so let’s unpack this shitshow.

**Last weekend,** I prepped for the snow. I went to H-E-B and got plenty of food for a week’s worth of meals. It was a busy day at the store.

I planned to roast a [buttermilk-brined chicken](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018731-buttermilk-brined-roast-chicken). I got fixings for sandwiches. I stocked up on refrigerated goods, like yogurt and cheese and veggies.

As I left the store, I thought, maybe I should have picked up some firewood; it would be nice to enjoy the snow with a fire going. Oh well. I headed home, with half a tank of gas.

**On Sunday night,** the snow started to fall. Dale and I woke up Monday morning to 8 inches of fresh snow. We had some fun:

We came back inside, warmed up, and I took a shower.

Then the power went out. Dale got to sleep in dad’s bed that night.

**On Tuesday morning,** we woke up to an inside temperature of 45º, and still no power.

After kicking myself for not picking up firewood, I remembered I had some DuraFlame logs in the closet, so I popped one of those in the fireplace and let it rip.

It didn’t do much. Evidently, those logs are for ✨ *cozy vibes only* ✨; there’s a very limited amount of heat a [sawdust candle](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/are-artificial-firelogs-any-good/) can put off.

So, I layered up, conserving as much warmth as I could while my battery pack drained out.

By mid-afternoon, I was feeling a little stir crazy, so I decided to see if I could escape to Houston. Since I didn’t fill up my car with gas over the weekend, that would be the first stop. After shoveling snow off the car with a dustpan, I took a cruise down the street.

There would be no escape. None of the gas stations had power. The roads were a disaster. So I carefully limped back home, and prepared to settle in for another cold night.

**About 24 hours after it went out,** the power returned. I cranked the heat and shut the bedroom door, hoping to trap as much heat as I could before the power dropped out again. After a few rolling blackouts, the power and heat held steady. I begrudgingly tossed all the fresh meat and dairy I’d bought a few days prior, which had been sitting in a room-temp fridge for the last day.

Then the water went out. I should have filled up the tub.

**On Wednesday,** we tried to solve our water problems. Worst case scenario, I’d grab buckets from the pool to flush the toilet. In the interim, I decided to melt some snow. A 13-gallon trash can filled with snow weighs about 35 pounds, which ends up being approximately 3-4 gallons of liquid water, or 2-3 toilet flushes. So we’d need to be… thoughtful.

Thankfully, we discovered a spigot on the side of our building that was still running. Using my mop bucket, I was able to haul water up to my 3rd floor apartment, 2 gallons at a time.

This continued into Thursday. Oh, and the water needed boiling to be safe to drink. It became a dance of clean vs. dirty containers, safe water and gray water. I kept a large bowl of water in the sink that I’d use to wash my hands. Eventually, that would become toilet water.

Resigned to living like this for another day (and having not showered since Monday morning), I was extremely excited when we got an email from our apartment management: we’d have water again on Friday afternoon.

**On Friday morning,** they sent a follow-up email. The city of Austin was having bigger water issues — all the reservoirs were empty. So, it likely would be a bit longer before water was restored. Oh, and FEMA is coming, so maybe try and get some water from them.

At this point, I’d had about enough. I packed up the dog into the car, locked the door, and headed out to Houston, hoping I’d find gas along the way.

Getting out of Austin was a bit touch-and-go, but once I hit Bastrop, things cleared up. I stopped at Buc-ee’s, topped off with premium (all the other tanks were empty), grabbed some jerky, and continued on the way.

I made it to Houston safely.

It was the best shower of my life.

## Reading

Most of my reading this week concerned Texas, the storm, and the cascading failures of Texas public utilities. These are the highlights.

- [“Why does Texas have it’s own power grid?”](https://www.texastribune.org/2011/02/08/texplainer-why-does-texas-have-its-own-power-grid/) 
- Bob Henson of the Yale School of the Environment on [how the US and Texas electric grids are uniquely susceptible to power outages](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/02/why-the-power-is-out-in-texas-and-why-other-states-are-vulnerable-too/).
- [“Texas vs. The Future”](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/texas-vs-the-future) from Noah Smith’s newsletter.
- [The deep inequalities exposed by the winter storm in Texas](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/texas-winter-storm-inequality), from Vanessa Wong for BuzzFeed News.
- “When you don’t want to face the consequences of your actions as a lawmaker — when you’d rather demonize scapegoats than give answers — you fight a culture war.” [Jamelle Bouie](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/opinion/ted-cruz-texas-cancun.html) for The New York Times.
- To wrap things up, [“Is This the End of Tipping?”](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/business/pandemic-restaurant-tipping.html) from Emma Goldberg for The New York Times. A look into the abuse, harassment, and shortchanged tips servers are experiencing in pandemic-era restaurant work. I maintain my theory: during the pandemic, the only people going out to restaurants are the ones who don’t value the lives of service industry workers, so you get all of the shitty customers, and none of the decent ones. 


## Watching
- *Search Party*. Another show about trashbag people with anxiety. It’s beautiful.
- *Breaking Bad*. Wrapped up the rewatch this week. Really need the newest season of *Better Call Saul* on Netflix, like, yesterday.
- *Moana*, for the fifth? sixth time?
- *Over the Garden Wall*. The boyfriend insisted we watch this when I said I’d never seen it, and I regret nothing. What a beautiful work of animated art. If you like *Adventure Time*, give it a shot; it’s 10 short episodes and a neatly-wrapped story.

And that’s the week. I need a vacation.
