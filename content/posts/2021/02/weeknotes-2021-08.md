This was a quiet week, trying to get back to normal after last week’s disaster. I gave myself a haircut, I tried not to [freak out](https://twitter.com/tnflnt/status/1365036139690737671) when they shut my water off again, I did three weeks of laundry, I restocked the fridge.

Also, I got my first dose of the vaccine. 

That’s a good way to end the month.

## Reading
- [An H-E-B explainer from The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/us/texas-heb-winter-storm.html). H-E-B is the national grocery store of Texas, and their [disaster response model](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/how-heb-became-emergency-preparedness-model/) is unmatched by anything at the government level.
- “Go sit in an uncomfortable chair, in an uncomfortable location, and stare at an uncomfortably small screen with an uncomfortably outdated web browser. How easy is it to use the websites you’ve created?” Terence Eden on [the effectiveness of simple, unfussy HTML](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/01/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-simple-html/).
- Zeynep Tufekci for The Atlantic on how [our public-health messaging has failed us](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/how-public-health-messaging-backfired/618147/) this year. I found the notion of “risk compensation” particularly interesting: the authorities assumed that the public would engage in risky behavior, so they overcompensated with their safety guidance; in reality, “…sociological theory predicted that wearing masks would be associated with increased adherence to other precautionary measures—people interested in staying safe are interested in staying safe—and empirical research quickly confirmed exactly that.”
- I learned about [new recreational drugs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/health/marijuana-hemp-delta-8-thc.html) in The New York Times, and my bones immediately crumbled to dust. I also immediately popped out to the local CBD vendor and picked some up. Verdict: they’re not kidding. Shit works. 

## Watching
- *Bojack Horseman*, for the second time. The highlights: Bojack finds the baby seahorse; get that fetus, kill that fetus. On second thought, maybe this show about mental illness and self-improvement is a bit too heavy for late-quarantine watching.
- *The Mummy* and *The Mummy Returns*. The first one, a true classic; the second one, more derivative than I remember (these are not a good back-to-back watch), and my goodness, that Scorpion King CGI.
- *Halt and Catch Fire*, the rewatch. This popped up on Netflix and it’s a solid follow-up to my *Mad Men* marathon from last month. Where *Mad Men* feels grounded in reality, though, this feels like an 80’s-tech nightmare; delightfully absurd. I loved the later seasons.

Next week, it’s March again. A full year of this shit. Woof.
