Window management on macOS is one of those things you either don’t think about at all, or think about *entirely too much*. I’m in the latter camp, with the rest of you nerds, and I was delightfully surprised when a new window manager popped up on my radar, [thanks to Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/hookshot).

There’s a few dozen window management apps out there, and most of them do the same few things, in slightly different ways: they’re here to help you tile open windows across your desktop so you can keep things tidy while you multitask.

I’m pretty sure I’ve tried (and bought) all the well-known, non-sketchy ones, and while there’s plenty to love, none hit all the right notes:

- A proper native Mac app.
- Lightweight, usually running from the menu bar.
- Hotkeys galore.
- Useful presets, and lots of customization.
- Fine-grained control over where the windows go: if I want to put 8px gutters between all my windows, or stick it in the center of my screen at 85% height and 1280px width, *let me do that*.
- Intelligent handling of edge cases: centering windows that don’t fully resize, accounting for panels, etc.

And, it’d be nice to do all of that without a chaotic, confusing, overwrought interface to set it all up.

[Hookshot](https://hookshot.app) does it all. 

## But first, let’s talk about those other apps…

I feel like I found [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) a decade ago, and it’s the one that got me started down this road. It’s good! Hit the shortcut, Divvy pops up a little window, you drag your mouse over a grid of squares, and you get a neatly-resized window. It’s got options for margins and gutters, grid density, and a preset-creation tool for your preferred window sizes.

Unfortunately, it seems to be abandoned. It still works on the latest macOS (points in the “good Mac app” column), but it feels like it’s a thing of the past — the Divvy control window looks like something out of the early 2010’s, the grid density and shape doesn’t *really* work well with today’s giant screens, it poorly handles windows that don’t fully resize, and who knows when or if it’ll see an update. I can’t really recommend it.

I dropped Divvy around 2017 after a few years of no updates (guess what: still no updates) and found my new love in [SizeUp](https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) from Irradiated Software. It did exactly what I needed it to, for a time. A menu bar app, SizeUp comes loaded with handy presets and keyboard shortcuts and plenty of options to tweak (including fine-grained control of my favorite preset, “center the damn window in the screen at the exact size I want”).

We had a lovely life together for several years, but it met the same fate as Divvy: abandonment issues. No updates in years, and a lack of useful presets for super high-res screens (you get quarter-screen partitions and that’s about it).

Hoping to find a non-abandoned window manager, I turned to the Mac App Store and others. Each one I tried let me down:

- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12), regularly at the top of “the best window managers for Mac” lists (*yes, these exist; yes, I read them*) was a bummer. It hits most of the key points, except the dealbreaker: no margins or gutters.
- [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/), a fun twist on the genre, augments your window’s “zoom” button with a little floating panel. A bit too chaotic and mouse-driven for me.
- [BetterSnapTool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12) coulda been a contender! It does so much! It does *too* much! The Instant Pot of window managers. It’s good. It’s a lot.

So, I stuck with SizeUp. It did the job, a reliable friend through the years.

## And then, I found Hookshot.

Hookshot seems like the cool new kid in the big corporate office. It’s lightweight. It’s fast. It checks all the boxes: Margins? Check. Good presets? Check. Super customizable? Check. Smart centering? Check. It does all the things, and more.

And, it’s got a trick up it’s sleeve — gesture based resizing of any window, even if they’re not in focus.

{{< youtube E7ES9TGqEZE >}}

Move your cursor over a window, hold down the hot keys (`CTRL`+`OPT`), and your cursor turns into a little dot. Swipe your cursor up, down, left, right, top-corner, bottom-corner, and throw your windows around. It’s the fastest way to organize an unruly mess of windows I’ve seen. And it’s *perfect* with a trackpad.

It’s been my daily driver for the last month or so, and I couldn’t be happier. I barely even use the shortcut presets any more — the gesture system is that good.

So, if you’ve made it this far and you’re thinking “hey I think I like this guy who rants about window managers on the internet”, [try Hookshot](https://hookshot.app). It’s very, very good.
