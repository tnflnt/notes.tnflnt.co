A tweet from Craig Mod caught my eye this morning… 

{{< tweet 1351497802199699456 >}} 

…with a link to [this new essay from Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters): a collection of thoughts around newsletters, a writer’s voice, RSS, monetization, ease of access, and how the whole writing-on-the-web thing fits together.

It’s *brilliant*. Not only the content of the essay, but the design of it, that captures the tone so perfectly. Rendle has *some thoughts* about the proliferation of newsletters and platforms like Substack, and reading this essay felt like stepping into his brain for a bit, the structure of the essay reflecting the back and forth, pros and cons, as he tries to sort out how he feels about writing for the internet now, at this moment. I flipped through the essay this morning in bed, slowly waking up, nodding along; it captures so many of the weird feelings I have towards newsletters: 

> I still think that using email to send words to each other is just entirely *ugh*. Perhaps I feel this way because reading everything in my inbox is somewhat antiquated. It’s almost as if we’ve gone back to reading off parchment after we invented books. Books are so much better than parchment in the same way that websites are so much better than email.

*YES!*

The essay is designed with some lightly-applied fancy scrolling, each beat [paired with an illustration](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/playing-flute/). It’s writing, published for the internet — a bespoke web page with a single piece of writing, built for consumption in a browser, in your hand, at your desk, wherever. I love this.

Craig Mod is a master of this internet-writing art form. His journals from his walks along the Kumano Kodō — along the [Nakahechi & Kohechi](https://walkkumano.com/koyabound/) in 2016, and the [Ise-ji](https://walkkumano.com/iseji/) in 2019 — are each built to explore digitally. He [records high-def audio](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/034/) along the walks, tracks his route with a Garmin watch, shoots dozens of photos each day, and combines it all into a rich, digital piece of writing. If you need an escape from your quarantine bunker, [go for a walk](https://walkkumano.com).
