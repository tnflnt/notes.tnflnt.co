Ted Goas hits on the right method for starting new design projects — [start in a Google Doc](https://uxdesign.cc/all-design-projects-should-start-in-a-google-doc-20ad24f75a8c). Define the requirements, the jobs to be done, and make this a collaborative effort. Too often, you'll jump into a "design the UI" method from the start — and when you start thinking of interface design right off the bat, you're missing the forest for the trees. Designers aren't the only ones guilty of this, I know more than a few PM's who start out writing "design tickets" with prescriptive details — "we need a button here, we need a modal that says this" — before even giving the designer a chance to understand and solve the actual problem.
