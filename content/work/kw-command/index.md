Command is a suite of real estate business tools for agents, including a CRM, marketing platform, design tools, and transaction management system. In 2017, Keller Williams decided to invest in building all the tools an agent would need to run their business in-house, eliminating dependencies on third-party services. I joined KW in 2019, and after the initial version of Command had been developed and tested with a select group of agents, it was time to build the next version of the platform for distribution to all 180,000 KW associates.

I led a redesign of the marketing and design tools within Command. This end-to-end platform allows agents to build campaigns for their clients and manage every step of the process, from designing marketing collateral, to running ad campaigns across Facebook, Twitter, and Google, to turning leads into sales.

I began by designing a new version of the Command web editor that agents use to build landing pages and emails with a no-code modular web layout system. I then overhauled the campaign management tool, building a comprehensive dashboard for seeing campaigns at a glance, and a unified campaign creation flow that adapts to each channel, from social ads to direct mail marketing.
